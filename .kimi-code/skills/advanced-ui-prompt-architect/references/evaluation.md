# Evaluation Checklist

## Automatic checks

- The system prompt includes the sections needed for the target agent's role, scope, context, tools, output contract, safety, failure handling, and self-checks
- The main instruction appears before context, examples, and detailed constraints
- All variable slots are either resolved or intentionally preserved
- No direct contradictions across role, scope, tools, and safety rules
- Tool instructions distinguish broad capabilities from real runtime tool specs
- When real tool specs are available, tool contracts include exact names, required inputs, expected output fields, missing-input behavior, post-call checks, conflict handling, and fallback actions
- When real tool specs are unavailable, the prompt asks for the missing specs or states explicit interface assumptions instead of inventing hidden APIs
- Semantic tool capabilities are written as behavior rules, not API-looking contracts with invented names, parameters, return fields, or call policies
- Code-side artifacts are kept out of the prompt: no schema/class/DTO names (e.g. `PushMessageDraft`), no raw field or column names, no pipeline-position labels (`upstream`, `downstream`, `policy module`), no backend-only behaviors (`write to database`, `落库`, `结构化校验失败`). Each such constraint is rewritten as agent-facing behavior; field labels appear only when they are part of the agent's required final output string
- The role is a real-world professional identity plus a domain (writer, copywriter, advisor, tutor, coach, analyst, designer, etc.), not a pipeline-step verb plus `agent`/`代理` (e.g. `学习提醒文案生成代理`, `risk-scoring agent`) and not a generic wrapper (`smart assistant`, `AI helper`)
- Data retention behavior is specified when the target agent stores, remembers, exports, or modifies user data; missing required retention policy is marked as a product decision the user must define
- If the task is factual, uncertainty and grounding rules are present
- The prompt uses the user's requested or implied language
- Section names, tags, labels, examples, and workflow templates use the user's requested or implied language
- The prompt prefers clear target behavior, output format, decision criteria, and alternative actions over abstract prohibitions
- Repeated rules are consolidated; the same behavior is not restated across multiple sections without adding a new decision criterion
- External source families are defined before grounding rules rely on them
- Common user workflows have compact output templates with section labels and completion criteria
- Domain boundaries include safe alternative actions, especially for academic, legal, medical, financial, privacy, or destructive-action contexts
- The final system prompt is compact enough for deployment, with section grouping treated as a heuristic rather than a fixed path
- Self-check content is short and focused on the highest-risk failures
- Self-check items are specific, observable, and where possible countable (e.g., "the output contains exactly the four required fields", "the risk level matches the input value"); vague checks like "the output is good" are removed or rewritten
- Prescribed steps are reusable methods the agent can apply across similar inputs, not one-off answers to a single example
- Where the prompt offers options, one option is named as the default and any escape hatch is bounded by a clear condition; pure menus of equally-weighted choices are removed
- Specificity is calibrated to fragility: ordered, prescriptive procedures appear only where mistakes are costly, ordering matters, or the runtime is fragile; flexible tasks are written as target behavior plus decision criteria
- Domain-specific rules are grounded in user-provided constraints or explicit assumptions, not hidden guesses
- Ambiguous labels distinguish response language from subject domain; the prompt asks for clarification or states the chosen assumption
- The draft has been compressed once before delivery to remove repeated rules and preserve only sections that change behavior
- Semantic tool capabilities are grouped only when grouping improves clarity; exact runtime specs keep their needed separations
- Output templates are compact label lists rather than long per-task policy sections
- Format-sensitive requirements include compact examples or labels; simple requirements stay zero-shot
- Optional prompt techniques are selected only when they improve observable behavior; reasoning-heavy prompts use concise visible summaries rather than full hidden reasoning
- Complex or multi-tool prompts include a compact tool contract covering name, use case, required inputs, optional inputs, returned fields, side effects, confirmation needs, failure handling, and result checks

## Safety checks

- Reasoning visibility is limited to the summary needed for the user-facing task
- Destructive or irreversible actions require confirmation and state the visible result
- Proprietary or hidden prompt content is protected through a safe redirection
- PII collection is limited to task-relevant fields

## Suggested thresholds

- required_section_coverage = 100%
- contradiction_count = 0
- critical_safety_violations = 0
- tool_contract_coverage = 100%
- factual_grounding_pass_rate >= 0.90 for grounded tasks
- style_conformity >= 4/5 on LLM judge

## Review order

1. Required section coverage
2. Safety and privacy
3. Tool contract executability
4. Runtime isolation (no leaked schema/field/pipeline names) and role grounding
5. Duplication and priority clarity
6. Length and section economy
7. Output templates and source definitions
8. Domain assumptions and explicit constraints
9. Domain fit and style

## Rollback rule

If a revision lowers any already-passing critical metric, revert to the last passing snapshot before making further edits.
